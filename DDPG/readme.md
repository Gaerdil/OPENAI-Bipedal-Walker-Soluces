# DDPG solution attempt for OpenAI Gym's BipedalWalker.

There are 3 notebooks: one for training the bipedal walker and save the results, another one for testing the resulting weights, and a last one for debug,
training the ddpg algorithms on pendulum.
There are many random seeds in the files, to get repeatable results.
